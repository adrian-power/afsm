This repo contains the .SQL (for MySQL) and .RMD files required to produce the paper, "Australian fungi, slime moulds and the people who find them" (AFSM), which can be downloaded from https://adrianpower.com/

As a contributor to iNaturalist I became interested in what insights I could gain from the data available about fungi and protozoa in Australia. My initial focus was on understanding species distributions, and then became interested in the human factor of how citizen science contributes to an evidence base.
