This repo contains the .SQL and .RMD files required to produce the paper, "Australian fungi, slime moulds and the people who find them" (AFSM), which can be downloaded from https://adrianpower.com/

The .SQL file is specifically designed for MySQL Server. 

As a contributer to iNaturalist I became interested in how the data collected is being used. I have a background in data and analytics and decided to look at the iNaturalist data to see what insights I could gain. My initial focus was on understanding species distributions, but also became interested in the human factor and how citizen science contributes to an evidence base. In this document, I celebrate the contributions of avid users who have significantly impacted the amount and quality of data available about fungi and protozoa in Australia.
